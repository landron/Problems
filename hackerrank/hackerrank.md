## Unfinished business

    tag_wip

  1. ["Project Euler #92: Square digit chains"](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler092)

     Scores: 75/100 (PyPy3), 62.5/100 (C++).

     Next: finish own C++ BigInteger class.      
     bigint library ("vcpkg install bigint --triplet x64-windows") is too large to be submitted with the problem (50k limit).
     
  2. ["Project Euler #79: Passcode derivation"](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler079)
     
     Next: a Python substring iterator class, so string fragments can be combined to obtain the best lexicographical match.
     
  3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-xor

     Next: find a clear algorithm, the aproach around the ideal match does not work well (in refining the scope)

     (tag_ub_<no problem>: tag_ub_3, by exemple)

  4. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-operations/problem

     Practice > Algorithms > Debugging > Minimum Operations
     Next: understand the algorithm to be able to really debug it (it fails for simple tests)
